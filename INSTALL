Please read the file README first.

Sorry, I have said you should read the file README first, also if
it is not your common habit.

Oh dear please read this view lines of the README file.

OK, now you know what it is.
Installation is only rudimentary and requres some work from
volunteers.  That's why I pointed you to the README file because
I wented to inform you that I will not add more comfort to this
package.  I only wanted to start the stone roling.  You can
keep it doing so yourself.

Prepend the call to ./install.sh by the following variables to
get the right locations.  I enclosed the default value in <>

PREFIX=</usr/local>
DOCDIR=</usr/local/doc/fortune-de-$VERSION>
FORTUNESDIR=</usr/local/share/games/fortunes>
BINDIR=</usr/local/bin>

Example (so it is used in the Debian build rule):

        PREFIX=`pwd`/debian/tmp DOCDIR=usr/share/doc/$(package) \
	FORTUNESDIR=$(inst_dir) BINDIR=/usr/bin ./install.sh

Just add "-utf8" option to the install.sh script to install datafiles
UTF-8 encoded.
	
	Happy fortunes
