README for fortune-de
---------------------

The database was compiled from several postings in usenet, open mailing
lists as well as web pages.  So it is public domain and I put this data
base under GPL or GPL-Deutsch. The database can be obtained under *both*
the original Englisch GPL *or* the German translation.  Please read the
introduction to GPL-Deutsch carefully to understand why the license is
not just the German translation itself but anadditional license.

The database might be a starting point for a German fortune database.
I want to make clear that I have no interest in maintaining the
database myself.  It should be just a starting kick.

How to enhance the Database?
Please read the file LIESMICH.  Ich your German is not good enough
to understand it, you might consider to enhance fortune databases
in other languages.
